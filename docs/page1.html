	<p class="history"> History of Mcdonald's:<br> McDonald's Corporation is an American fast food company, founded in 1940 as a restaurant operated by Richard and Maurice McDonald,<br> in San Bernardino, California, United States. They rechristened their business as a hamburger stand, and later turned the<br> company into a franchise, with the Golden Arches logo being introduced in 1953 at a location in Phoenix, Arizona. In 1955, Ray Kroc, a<br> businessman, joined the company as a franchise agent and proceeded to purchase the chain from the McDonald brothers. McDonald's<br> had its previous headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois, but moved its global headquarters to Chicago in June 2018.</p>
